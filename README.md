Organize your tabs by renaming and coloring your tabs!
Save your tabs according to color and relaunch them with a click of a button!

ActivityTab allows you to effectively keep track of your tabs by allowing you to rename, color, and save your tabs. Accessible through the extension popup, commands, or context menu, ActivityTab allows you to quickly modify your tabs to your liking and save them so you can swiftly launch a set of tabs that you want to return to.

Features:
●  Rename a tab
●  Save colored tabs
●  Save all tabs
●  Close tabs of a specified color
●  Creation of tab groups that keep track of your saved tabs

Once set, the name and color of a tab will persist when changing webpages and when the tab is refreshed. To save tabs of a certain color, select a tab with that color and then save it.

Once you install the extension, make sure to refresh your tabs so that the extension will work on them (they do not recognize the extension since they were opened before the extension was installed).

About Permissions: I need the permission “Read and change all your data on the websites you visit” so that the extension can rename and color webpages from any website. I don’t store anything about you as everything is stored on your computer.

Pictures of the extension features can be found above, and detailed explanations of the extension features can be found below.
